## Structuring Your Documentation

There are some key sections you should cover in your documentation. They are in no particular order.

- A description of what your library does
- Why your library is important or different
- Installation instructions, or how to set up your project
- How to use your library or an example
- Advanced instructions or detailed documentation on how to configure your library

If your documentation is big or comlex, then consider adding a table of contents, or splitting your documnentation up.

### What to Include in the Header

You can include badges/shields which let users know at a glance certain information about your project. This can include, what platform it works on, what features it supports, and if it belongs to a framework.

### Describing Your Project


Provide a brief summary of what your project does and how it does it. If it's an extension of an existing framework, like a plugin let the user know this, it will help them understand how to integrate your project into their own.

### Explaining It's Usage

When explaining it's usage try to follow an example which the user can follow. If necessary use numbering or lists to show the order of which to follow the instructions.

### Describing the Installation

Try to keep the instructions for installing or setting up your project as simple and as concise as possible. Make it easy for your users to get your project up and running. If you can, it's helpful to provide a way for them to know it's working.

### Writing Good Copy

Try to keep your readme file concise and well structured. Use images when appropriate to help explain or draw attention to your documentation. Avoid using long sentences.

### Common Heading Names

Below are some examples of common heading names used by other repos.

```
Getting Started, Quickstart, Usage, Example, Features,
Install, Installation, Setup, Configure
Options, API, Config, Methods, Development
```
